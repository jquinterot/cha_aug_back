# Steps to set up GitHub Actions CI/CD with Docker Hub deployment

1. Create a Docker Hub account (if you don't have one).
2. Create a repository on Docker Hub for your image (e.g., johany/chat_aug_back).
3. In your GitHub repo, go to Settings > Secrets and variables > Actions > New repository secret:
   - Add DOCKERHUB_USERNAME (your Docker Hub username)
   - Add DOCKERHUB_TOKEN (a Docker Hub access token or password)
4. Create a .github/workflows/ci.yml file in your repo with the following steps:
   - Checkout code
   - Set up Python (if you want to run tests)
   - (Optional) Install dependencies and run tests
   - Log in to Docker Hub using secrets
   - Build the Docker image (e.g., docker build -t johany/chat_aug_back:latest .)
   - Push the image to Docker Hub
5. Commit and push the workflow file to GitHub
6. On every push to main (or on PR), the workflow will build and deploy the image to Docker Hub

# Example workflow file: .github/workflows/ci.yml
# (You can ask the assistant to generate this for you!)
